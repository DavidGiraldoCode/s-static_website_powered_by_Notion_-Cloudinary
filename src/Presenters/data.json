			"plain_text": "The concept of non-endemic brands accounts for companies not related to gaming: They seek to engage with gamers through well-known strategies like advergames, in-game advertising, or sponsorship (KFC being a top player). However, an underlying formula is needed to increase the chances of getting a positive response from the demanding gaming audience. I coined the strategy \"The gaming formula\" = EP + CC + EP *endemic partner + communication channel + enabler platform."

Even when sweetened drinks are common for boosting energy among regular gamers. Interestingly, non-endemic food brands seek to enable connections and interactions between people through gaming-related initiatives instead of pairing the consumption and gaming moment together."
